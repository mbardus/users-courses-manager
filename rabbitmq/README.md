# Message Broker Documentation

This directory contains the setup and configuration details for the message broker used in the cloud microservices application. The message broker facilitates communication between the microservices (Users, Courses, Enrollments) through asynchronous messaging.

## Technologies Used
- **Message Broker**: [Insert message broker name, e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka]
- **Spring Cloud Stream**: For building event-driven microservices.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Installation**: Follow the installation instructions for the chosen message broker.
2. **Configuration**: Update the configuration files in the respective microservices to connect to the message broker.
3. **Running the Broker**: Use Docker or Kubernetes to run the message broker as a containerized service.

## Communication Flow
- Users service publishes events related to user actions.
- Courses service listens for user events to update course availability.
- Enrollments service processes enrollment requests and communicates with both Users and Courses services.

## Monitoring and Management
- Use the management interface provided by the message broker for monitoring message queues and managing subscriptions.
